                        possibility

                        define my future. I learned about my attachment style, core wounds and personality needs and how

                        have been affecting the quality of my life currently. Thais gives clear instructions as to how

            I’m a personal development expert, best-selling author and founder of The Personal Development School.
            </br></br>

            After completing my master’s degree and over 13 different certifications in a variety of disciplines such as
            Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Hypnosis, Somatic Experiencing and more – I ran an extremely busy client-based
            practice for the better part of a decade.</br></br>

            Now I help clients across the globe transform their relationships and overcome lifelong emotional challenges
            through the Personal Development School.</br></br>

            Since co-creating the Personal Development School, and my years of research and client experience, I have
            become a leading authority on healing attachment trauma, and have built a thriving membership and online
            community, including over 10 million views on YouTube.
